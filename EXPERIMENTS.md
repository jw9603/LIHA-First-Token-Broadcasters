# Experiments

An index of every experiment in this repo, for writing the paper. Each entry says why it was run, what and how,
when, where the results are and which code produced them, then what the result shows and what it doesn't.
results/RESULTS.md is the running log with the full tables; this file is the short version. Status as of 2026-10-10.

## Shared setup

- Data: 2,500 FLORES prompts, 500 per language in en/fr/de/es/it (495 FLORES-200 devtest sentences plus 5
  hand-written starts, built with the rules of the original expand_dataset.py). Head screens use the first 25 per
  language (125 prompts). The Language Confusion Benchmark (LCB, Marchisio et al. 2024) adds monolingual prompts
  written in the language and crosslingual prompts in English asking for a reply in another language.
- Intervention: one attention head at a time. Zero ablation sets the head's slice of the input to the attention output
  projection to zero. Mean ablation (followup.py; PR #6 for GPT-2 small) replaces it with its mean over the prompt
  tokens of the 2,500 FLORES prompts; for instruct models those tokens include the chat template. Scaling multiplies
  it.
- Metrics on FLORES: the language of the greedy 40-token continuation (langdetect, seed 0). c->w is the share of all
  prompts that are in the prompt's language at baseline and in another language with the head removed, w->c the
  reverse, and the switch rate (SR) their sum. dNLL is the head's change in LM loss on 100 FLORES dev sentences per
  language, shown next to the mean change for the other heads in the same layer.
- Metrics on LCB: the benchmark's line-level pass rate (LPR), averaged over its sources, with paired bootstrap 95%
  CIs on the change.
- Instruct models get each prompt as a single user turn with their own chat template (one BOS, thinking off, a fixed
  date where the template inserts one). Qwen2.5's template adds its default English system prompt.
- Hardware: one H100 80GB. fp16 for Qwen2.5-1.5B, bf16 for OLMo-2-1B base, OLMo-3-7B and Qwen2.5-7B, fp32 for
  everything else.

## 1. Hook check and reproduction

- Why: to reproduce the submitted numbers before building on them.
- What: GPT-2 small (the paper's 25 hand-written prompts), Qwen2.5-1.5B base and instruct (125 prompts, as in
  qwen_experiment.py) and BLOOM-1b7 (25 prompts), with the paper's settings.
- How: the original hook and a corrected one, side by side. The original hook zeroes a slice of the attention output
  after the output projection. After the projection every output dimension combines all heads, so the zeroed slice
  does not correspond to one head; in BLOOM the zeroed tensor also contains the residual stream. The corrected hook
  zeroes the head's slice of the input to the output projection.
- When / where: 2026-10-06 to 10-07; results/gpt2, results/qwen-instruct, results/qwen-base,
  results/bloom-paper25-fp16; RESULTS.md, first sections.
- Code: experiments/sweep.py (`--modes paper` for the original hook, `--modes head` for the corrected one).
- Result: with the original hook, GPT-2 reproduces within one prompt (L6H1 0.28, paper 0.32) and Qwen instruct L0H5
  gives 0.224, as in the paper. BLOOM does not reproduce with its own settings (largest switch rate 0.20, paper 0.16);
  its script uses head size 64, while bloom-1b7 has 128. With the corrected hook, GPT-2 L6H1 has a switch rate of
  0.038 on 2,500 prompts (rank 136 of 144) and Qwen instruct L0H5 0.056 on the 125 prompts (rank 38 of 336). The GPT-2
  layer-0 heads with high switch rates raise LM loss by +0.78 to +1.30, and some of them (L0H0) mostly flip outputs
  from wrong to correct.
- Reading: the head-ablation numbers in the submitted version come from the original hook. Under the corrected hook
  the first-token broadcaster heads it reported (GPT-2 L6H1, Qwen L0H5) change the output language little, and the
  large layer-0 effects in GPT-2 come with large LM loss increases.

## 2. GPT-2 small with the corrected hook

- Why: to find which GPT-2 heads change the output language under the corrected hook.
- What: all 144 heads on the 2,500 FLORES prompts. Follow-ups on the top heads: several heads ablated together,
  scaling by 2 to 5, first-token attention, 100 zh and 100 ru prompts, sampling (temperature 0.7, three seeds),
  prompts cut to their first half, two more language detectors and random half splits, replacement by per-language
  means, output quality and content, and mean ablation and downstream attention redistribution (PR #6).
- How: zero ablation per head. Follow-ups use the heads with the largest c->w among those with dNLL at most 0.1, and
  control heads drawn at random from the dNLL <= 0.1 heads outside the top ten.
- When / where: 2026-10-06 to 10-08; results/gpt2, gpt2-multi*, gpt2-amp, gpt2-attention, gpt2-zhru, gpt2-sampling,
  gpt2-truncated, gpt2-identity, gpt2-content, gpt2-mean-ablation, gpt2-redistribution, results/quality.md;
  tables/README.md.
- Code: sweep.py, multi.py, amplify.py, attention.py, checks.py, robustness.py, identity.py, quality.py, content.py;
  PR #6 for mean ablation and redistribution.
- Result:
  - L6H10 has the largest c->w among the heads with dNLL <= 0.1 (0.210, dNLL +0.016) and the lowest accuracy of the
    144 single-head ablations (0.229; non-English 0.296 to 0.038). 511 of the 524 flipped outputs are English. Mean
    ablation gives c->w 0.177; over all 144 heads, c->w under mean and zero ablation correlates at Spearman 0.69.
  - Ablating up to ten heads in order of c->w keeps accuracy at 0.23 to 0.31 while dNLL rises to +0.49.
  - Scaling L6H10 by 5 raises accuracy from 0.435 to 0.870 (dNLL +0.041). At 5x, 76% of the outputs in the prompt's
    language repeat themselves and 15% copy the prompt (quality.py's split applied to the gpt2-amp outputs).
  - With langid, fastText and a 2-of-3 vote, c->w per head correlates with langdetect at Spearman 0.994 or higher and
    L6H10 stays first among the dNLL <= 0.1 heads. Across 200 random half splits it is first in both halves every
    time.
  - Sampling: L6H10 c->w 0.256 to 0.272 across seeds (greedy 0.210). Prompts cut mid-sentence: baseline non-English
    accuracy 0.716, L6H10 c->w 0.095, control heads 0.02 to 0.08.
  - zh/ru: c->w per head correlates with the European set at Spearman 0.64 (switch rate 0.79), and 4 of the top ten
    c->w heads are shared.
  - First-token attention correlates negatively with the ablation effect (Spearman -0.52 with the switch rate).
  - At baseline, 57% of the outputs that stay in the prompt's language are repetition and 35% copy the prompt. For the
    prompts L6H10 sends to English, similarity to the prompt goes from 0.453 to 0.195 (unrelated FLORES sentence
    0.18).
  - Replacing L6H10 with any language's mean, including the prompt's own, sends 0.78 to 0.96 of the non-English
    outputs to English.
  - Redistribution (PR #6): ablating L6H10 raises first-token attention in downstream heads (no matched permutation
    out of 100,000 reaches the observed value), and across the 12 layer-6 heads the increase correlates with c->w
    (rho 0.70 with zero ablation, 0.81 with mean ablation).
- Reading: GPT-2 has one mid-layer head whose removal sends non-English continuations to English, and the result is
  the same across detectors, prompt splits and sampling. The continuations it keeps in the prompt's language are
  mostly repetition or copies, and without it GPT-2 writes English unrelated to the prompt, unlike the instruct models
  of sections 4 and 9a, where the content is kept. The effect is much smaller when the prompt stops mid-sentence. The
  head's per-language average output does not reproduce its effect. The redistribution result shows that attention
  changes downstream; PR #6 notes that it does not by itself show compensation.

## 3. Other models without chat tuning

- Why: to check whether base models other than GPT-2 small have a single head that changes the output language.
- What: GPT-2 medium (24 x 16 heads), BLOOM-1b7 (24 x 16), Pythia-1B (16 x 8) and OLMo-2-1B base (16 x 16), every
  head on the 2,500 FLORES prompts.
- How: the same sweep, then mean ablation and scaling by 2, 3 and 5 on the top three heads by c->w with dNLL <= 0.1.
  BLOOM, GPT-2 medium and Pythia run in fp32, OLMo-2 base in bf16. OLMo-2 base ends the document right after most
  FLORES sentences, so it runs with the end-of-text token blocked.
- When / where: 2026-10-07 to 10-08; results/gpt2-medium, results/bloom, results/pythia-1b, results/olmo2-1b and
  their -followup folders.
- Code: sweep.py, followup.py.
- Result:
  - GPT-2 medium: L13H6 (layer 13 of 24; L6H10 is in layer 6 of 12) takes non-English accuracy from 0.300 to 0.066
    with dNLL +0.006, and 476 of the 479 flipped outputs are English. Mean ablation gives c->w 0.151 (zero 0.192).
  - BLOOM-1b7: 482 of the 2,500 baseline outputs are empty because the model ends the document. Mean switch rate
    0.011. The top c->w head (L23H12) stops generation instead of changing the language. The heads that do change
    it are in layers 18 to 21 and act on one language each; the largest, L21H15, takes German from 0.834 to 0.634.
  - Pythia-1B: baseline non-English accuracy 0.990. L1H7 has c->w 0.635 because 1,456 of the 2,500 outputs become
    empty (newlines only), 309 of them for English prompts. No other head has c->w above 0.044 (L9H3).
  - OLMo-2-1B base: baseline non-English accuracy 0.921. Among the heads with dNLL <= 0.1, L15H5 in the last layer
    has the largest c->w, 0.134 (next 0.072), with dNLL +0.035, on French, Spanish and Italian but not German; mean
    ablation gives 0.115. Five heads with dNLL +0.21 to +0.55 reach 0.142 to 0.175.
- Reading: among these base models, GPT-2 medium has one head with a large effect on all four languages, as GPT-2
  small does; BLOOM and Pythia have none; among OLMo-2 base's heads with dNLL <= 0.1, one acts on the Romance
  languages. Section 7 shows
  that the Qwen2.5 and Gemma-3-4B base models also have one, at c->w 0.15 to 0.20.

## 4. Qwen2.5-1.5B, base and instruct

- Why: Qwen2.5-1.5B is the instruct model of the submitted version and the model studied in the most detail here.
- What: all 336 heads (28 x 12) of the base and instruct models on the 2,500 FLORES prompts; mean ablation and
  scaling on the top heads of the instruct model; L22H6 and the L17 heads with two other input formats (instruct on
  raw text, base with the chat template) and three system prompt settings (Qwen's default English system prompt, no
  system prompt, the default translated into the prompt's language); the form and content of the replies.
- How: zero ablation sweep; followup.py; checks.py `qwen-format` and `qwen-system`; quality.py; content.py
  (Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B similarity between the prompt and the continuation).
- When / where: 2026-10-07 to 10-08; results/qwen-instruct-full, qwen-base-full, qwen-instruct-2500 (with content/
  and quality.md), qwen-instruct-followup, qwen-format-2500, qwen-system-2500; figures/fig1_qwen_c2w.
- Code: sweep.py, followup.py, checks.py, quality.py, content.py, figures.py.
- Result:
  - L22H6 has the largest c->w in both models: 0.500 in instruct (next L17H7 0.325 and L17H8 0.235; mean over all
    heads 0.019) and 0.150 in base (next 0.023; mean 0.003).
  - In instruct, non-English retention goes from 0.902 to 0.278 (fr 0.978 to 0.544, de 0.822 to 0.210, es 0.840 to
    0.350, it 0.968 to 0.008). French, German and Spanish replies go to English; Italian ones to Spanish (208),
    English (165), Portuguese (79) and French (26).
  - dNLL +0.228, against +0.004 for the other heads of layer 22. In base, +0.216.
  - Mean ablation: L22H6 c->w 0.450; L17H7 0.016 and L17H8 0.076.
  - System prompt: c->w 0.500 with the default English one (baseline retention 0.902), 0.258 with none (0.983) and
    0.379 with the translated one (0.996).
  - Input format: on raw text, instruct 0.176 and base 0.150; with the chat template, instruct 0.500 and base 0.089.
  - Of the 1,804 baseline replies in the prompt's language, 0% are repetition and 1% copy the prompt. For the 918
    prompts that L22H6 sends to English, similarity to the prompt is 0.475 before and 0.558 after (next FLORES
    sentence 0.384, random sentence 0.179).
- Reading: in this model, removing one head takes most non-English replies out of their language, and the effect
  stays under mean ablation. The same head exists in the base model with less than a third of the effect. The two
  models are close on raw text, and only the instruct model with its own chat template depends strongly on the head.
  The default English system prompt lowers baseline retention and enlarges the effect, but L22H6 matters in all three
  settings. The L17 heads lose most of their zero-ablation effect under mean ablation. In the base model L22H6 raises
  LM loss by a similar amount (+0.216) but changes far fewer replies (0.150), so the loss increase does not by itself
  produce the switch. The replies that switch to English keep the prompt's content.

## 5. Qwen2.5-1.5B on the Language Confusion Benchmark

- Why: FLORES measures how a model continues a sentence. LCB (Marchisio et al. 2024) measures whether a chat model
  replies in the language the user writes in (monolingual) or asks for (crosslingual).
- What: Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct.
  - Five languages: fr/de/es/it monolingual (800 prompts) and crosslingual (1,196), plus 200 English prompts. L22H6,
    L17H7 and L17H8 with zero and mean ablation, scaling (L22H6 x2, L17H7 x2, L17H8 x3), and three random control
    heads from each of layers 17 and 22.
  - All 14 non-English LCB languages (2,200 monolingual, 4,186 crosslingual): L22H6 and three controls from layer 22.
  - Sampling with the model's own settings (temperature 0.7, top-p 0.8, top-k 20, repetition penalty 1.1), two
    seeds, five languages.
- How: 100 new tokens, greedy except for the sampling runs, where each batch uses the same seed in every condition.
  LPR as in LCB's compute_metrics.py, averaged over sources; paired bootstrap 95% CIs on the change, pooled over the
  non-English prompts. Chinese and Japanese are segmented with jieba and MeCab before the 5-word line filter. Mean
  ablation uses the head's mean over the 2,500 FLORES prompts.
- When / where: 2026-10-08 to 10-09; results/qwen-instruct-lcb, qwen-instruct-lcb-all (with wpr.md),
  qwen-instruct-lcb-t07-s0 and -s1. Every reply is in samples.jsonl.gz.
- Code: lcb.py; lcb_wpr.py for the benchmark's word-level pass rate (WPR).
- Result:
  - Five languages, greedy: L22H6 zero takes monolingual LPR from 0.982 to 0.747 (paired change -0.273 [-0.305,
    -0.240]) and crosslingual from 0.704 to 0.427 (-0.276 [-0.303, -0.250]). Mean ablation: -0.246 and -0.247. The
    six control heads: -0.004 to +0.005 monolingual, -0.022 to 0.000 crosslingual.
  - L17H7 zero -0.065 monolingual and -0.036 crosslingual, L17H8 zero -0.004 and -0.008. Their mean ablation raises
    crosslingual LPR (+0.068 and +0.039). Scaling: L17H8 x3 +0.008 and +0.005, L22H6 x2 +0.001 and -0.186.
  - Sampling: L22H6 zero -0.273 and -0.274 monolingual, -0.245 and -0.276 crosslingual for the two seeds; controls
    -0.013 to +0.006.
  - 14 languages: monolingual 0.973 to 0.777 (-0.213 [-0.231, -0.195]) and crosslingual 0.666 to 0.386 (-0.277
    [-0.292, -0.263]); mean ablation -0.257 and -0.286; controls -0.001 to +0.007. Monolingual by language: it 1.00
    to 0.00, hi 0.99 to 0.39, tr 0.95 to 0.39, pt 0.95 to 0.54, fr 0.99 to 0.73, while ru stays at 1.00 and zh at
    0.98, and ja goes from 0.96 to 0.95. In the line labels of the replies that pass at baseline and fail without
    the head: crosslingual lines go mostly to English, except Italian and Portuguese (mostly Spanish); monolingual
    lines go mostly to Spanish for Italian, Portuguese, French and Indonesian, to Portuguese for Spanish, to English
    for Turkish, Arabic and Vietnamese, and, as labeled by fastText, to Korean and Russian for Hindi (56 and 39
    lines); some Turkish replies switch to Korean mid-reply.
  - Without the head, 11 of 100 monolingual and 50 of 299 crosslingual Korean replies turn into Chinese or Japanese
    and are skipped by the line filter, against 3 and 8 skipped replies of any kind at baseline.
  - WPR, which the benchmark reports for ar, hi, ja, ko, ru and zh (among replies whose lines are all in the
    language, the share without an English dictionary word): 0.96 to 0.99 monolingual and 0.93 to 0.99 crosslingual
    at baseline. With L22H6 zeroed or mean-ablated, Hindi drops (monolingual 0.98 to 0.89 and 0.82, crosslingual 0.99
    to 0.83 and 0.83) and the other five languages change by 0.03 or less; the controls keep Hindi at 0.99 to 1.00.
- Reading: L22H6 matters on LCB, in both tasks, under sampling and in most of the 14 languages; Chinese, Japanese and
  Russian change by 0.03 or less. The monolingual and crosslingual drops are similar in size, which fits a head that
  tracks the language the reply should be in, whether the prompt is written in it or asks for it. The L17 heads and
  the scaling that raised FLORES retention do not carry over to LCB, and doubling L22H6 lowers crosslingual LPR. The
  Korean drop is understated because of the filter. In Hindi, replies that stay in Hindi line by line start to
  carry English words without the head. An earlier version of the 14-language results split Chinese and
  Japanese on whitespace and skipped almost all of them (commit dfce47e); the numbers here are rescored.

## 6. Mechanism of L22H6, and of Gemma-3-1B's L11H3 (PR #12)

- Why: to find when the head acts and what it reads.
- What: Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct in fp32 with eager attention (transformers 4.57.6). 96 crosslingual LCB prompts, 24
  per language, all answered in the requested language at baseline. The 24 Italian prompts are ones whose reply had
  switched language under full removal of L22H6 in an earlier run; of the 72 French, German and Spanish prompts, 64
  had kept their language and 8 had switched. Also a pilot of 32 new prompts, 8 per language, that name the
  requested language and a second, unrelated one.
- How: L22H6 zeroed only while the prompt is read, only while the reply is generated, or both, with L22H8 as a
  control head; L22H6's attention weights to the requested language word; during generation, masking only L22H6's
  attention to that word, against masking a nearby token or the same word for L22H8; in the pilot, masking the
  requested or the unrelated language word. Pass or fail is LCB's line check on 100 new tokens.
- When / where: 2026-10-08; PR #12 (merged 2026-10-10), results/qwen-l22h6-mechanism.
- Code: experiments/liha_l22h6_reproduce.py and tools/analyze_l22h6_results.py (PR #12).
- Result:
  - Replies passing, out of 96: clean 95, L22H8 removed 94, L22H6 removed only on the prompt 88, only during
    generation 69, both 64. Italian: 24, 24, 21, 0 and 0 of 24. French, German and Spanish: 21 to 24 of 24 under
    every condition.
  - At the last prompt position L22H6 puts 0.705 (German) to 0.867 (Spanish) of its attention on the requested
    language word (0.807 over the 96 prompts), against 0.002 to 0.003 on a nearby token. The mean of three other
    heads of layer 22 (H4, H8 and H9) is 0.005 to 0.009; the other eight were not measured. During the reply the
    share is 0.33 to 0.48 early on and 0.18 to 0.26 later.
  - Of the 95 replies that pass at baseline, masking the edge to the requested word during generation fails 7 (4
    Italian, 2 German, 1 French), all among the 27 that fail when the whole head is removed during generation (24
    Italian). Masking a nearby token, or the word for L22H8, fails none.
  - Pilot, 31 replies that pass at baseline: masking the requested word fails 4 (all Italian, 4 of 8), masking the
    unrelated word fails none, removing the head during generation fails 9 (all 8 Italian). Mean attention is 0.79
    on the requested word and 0.01 on the unrelated one.
- Reading: on these prompts the head acts mostly while the reply is generated: removing it only during generation
  reproduces all 24 Italian switches, removing it only on the prompt 3. It attends strongly to the requested language
  word, and cutting just that access reproduces 7 of the 27 switches. The large effect is on Italian, whose prompts
  were selected among those that switch; on French, German and Spanish, where most prompts had not switched before,
  every condition passes 21 or more of 24. In the pilot the two masked words get very different attention (0.79 and
  0.01), so it does not separate what the word says from how much it is attended.
- Monolingual run (PR #12, MONOLINGUAL.md): 96 LCB monolingual prompts, 24 per language, drawn with a fixed seed
  without conditioning on earlier ablation results (Italian and German from Okapi only, French and Spanish 8 each
  from Dolly, Native and Okapi). Passes out of 96: clean 96, L22H8 removed 96, L22H6 removed only on the prompt 94,
  only during generation 65, both 61; Italian 24, 24, 23, 0 and 0 of 24, the other three languages 18 to 24. Its
  check script passes on the committed outputs, and with L22H6 fully removed its pass or fail matches our fp16
  batched LCB run (section 5) on all 96 prompts.
- Gemma-3-1B's L11H3 (PR #12, results/gemma-l11h3-mechanism, experiments/gemma_l11h3_attention.py): the same design
  on gemma-3-1b-it in fp32 with eager attention, on 96 crosslingual LCB prompts that name the requested language, 24
  per language, drawn without regard to Gemma's earlier replies; L11H0 is the control head, and every intervention
  acts only during generation.
  - At the last prompt position L11H3 puts 0.136 of its attention on the requested language word, against 0.009 on
    as many nearby tokens. The layer's other three heads put 0.025 (L11H0), 0.095 (L11H1) and 0.066 (L11H2) on the
    word.
  - Gemma-3-1B's crosslingual baseline is low (section 8): 12 of the 95 scorable replies pass. Masking the edge to
    the requested word during generation leaves 5, removing the head during generation leaves 4, and masking a
    nearby token or the word for L11H0 leaves 12. The two interventions fail 7 and 8 of the 12, and 4 replies fail
    under both, so they fail partly different replies.
  - Its clean replies are identical to our Gemma-3-1B LCB baseline replies on all 96 prompts, and rescoring every
    reply with lcb.py gives the same pass counts and agrees with the committed flags on all 480 outputs.
  - Reading: in the model where steering with the head fixes the most crosslingual replies (section 11), the head
    also attends to the requested language word, though less exclusively than L22H6 (L11H1 puts 0.095 on it), and
    cutting that access costs about as many passing replies as removing the head during generation. With 12
    passing replies the sample is small.
- Two checks (2026-10-10, 21:01 to 21:58 KST; experiments/mechanism_checks.md, written before the runs; results in
  results/gemma-l11h3-mechanism-ctrl1 and results/qwen-l22h6-mechanism-unselected, read by
  experiments/mechanism_check_reading.py into results/mechanism-checks/summary.md): PR #12's runner, now taking the
  model, layer and heads as options, on Gemma-3-1B and Qwen2.5-1.5B with the same 96 prompts as the Gemma run above,
  and as control the other head of the layer that attends most to the language name.
  - Gemma-3-1B: the rerun reproduces PR #12's replies in the four shared conditions on all 96 prompts. The control
    head is L11H1 (0.095 on the name, against 0.136 for L11H3; the plan's 0.096 rounded 0.0955 twice). Of the 12
    passing replies, masking L11H3's attention to the name fails 7, masking L11H1's fails none and the nearby mask
    none (exact McNemar 7 vs 0, p = 0.016 against each).
  - Qwen2.5-1.5B: 62 of the 96 replies pass without intervention (de 12, es 17, fr 18, it 15). In layer 22, L22H6
    puts 0.774 on the name, the next head (L22H7) 0.042 and the other ten 0.020 or less. Masking L22H6's attention
    to the name fails 6 (es 3, it 2, fr 1), masking L22H7's none and the nearby mask none (6 vs 0, p = 0.031
    against each); removing the head during generation fails 20, 15 of them Italian (every passing Italian reply),
    and 5 of the 6 are among the 20. Two replies that fail without intervention pass with the mask, and two with
    the head removed.
  - Reading: by the planned rule, in both models the edge to the name is specific to the head, and in Qwen2.5-1.5B
    PR #12's edge result holds on prompts drawn without selection. No other head of layer 22 attends to the name
    comparably, so Qwen2.5-1.5B's control is not matched in attention mass; Gemma-3-1B's is closer (0.095 against
    0.136) but rests on 12 replies. Cutting the access fails fewer replies than removing the head (6 against 20 in
    Qwen2.5-1.5B), so it explains part of the head's effect, as in PR #12.

## 7. Base and instruct pairs across families

- Why: to check whether instruct models of other families have a head like L22H6, and whether their base models have
  the same head.
- What: the instruct and base models of Qwen2.5-3B and 7B, Qwen3-1.7B and 4B (thinking off), Gemma-3-1B and 4B,
  OLMo-2-1B, Llama-3.2-1B and 3B, OLMo-3-7B and SmolLM3-3B (thinking off), on the FLORES prompts. fp32, except
  OLMo-3-7B and Qwen2.5-7B in bf16.
- How: every head of the instruct model is screened on 125 prompts. If the strongest head reaches c->w 0.1 on the
  screen, the layers holding the top two heads by c->w and the top head with dNLL <= 0.1 are rerun on all 2,500
  prompts, and the top three heads with dNLL <= 1 get mean ablation and scaling. The head that the later sections use
  is the one with the largest c->w on the 2,500 prompts among the heads with dNLL <= 1 whose removal keeps at least
  0.9 of the English continuations in English (experiments/head_rule.md). The English condition was written down on
  2026-10-10, after Qwen2.5-7B's top head turned English continuations into digit strings; it states why SmolLM3-3B's
  L1H12 was set aside, and it changes none of the other choices. Base models: Qwen2.5-3B, Qwen3-1.7B,
  Gemma-3-4B and OLMo-3-7B go through the same steps; Gemma-3-1B's base stayed under the threshold on the screen and
  its layers 5 and 11 were run on 2,500 prompts anyway; OLMo-2-1B's base has the full sweep of section 3;
  Qwen2.5-7B's base has the instruct head's layer 19 on 2,500 prompts. The Llama base models were not run, since
  neither instruct model reached the threshold, and neither was Qwen3-4B's. SmolLM3-3B instruct reached it only
  through a head that breaks generation (below); its run was stopped after the screen and its base was not run.
- When / where: 2026-10-08 to 10-10; results/<model>-screen, results/<model>, results/<model>-followup.
- Code: sweep.py, followup.py; detectors.py for the detector check (results/detectors).
- Result (2,500 prompts unless marked):

| model | heads per layer | baseline non-English retention | head | c->w, zero | c->w, mean | dNLL (rest of layer) | other heads of the layer, max c->w | same head in base, zero (mean) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen2.5-1.5B | 12 | 0.902 | L22H6 | 0.500 | 0.450 | +0.228 (+0.004) | 0.007 | 0.150 |
| Qwen2.5-3B | 16 | 0.992 | L27H13 | 0.515 | 0.338 | +0.234 (+0.006) | 0.014 | 0.202 (0.114) |
| Qwen2.5-7B (bf16) | 28 | 0.996 | L19H1 | 0.200 | 0.018 | +0.026 (+0.001) | 0.006 | 0.025 (0.011) |
| Qwen3-1.7B | 16 | 0.994 | L18H12 | 0.324 | 0.028 | +0.128 (+0.003) | 0.002 | 0.067 (0.022) |
| Qwen3-4B | 32 | 0.980 on the screen | none on FLORES; strongest L8H3, 0.024 on the screen (a crosslingual head, L24H27, section 8) | | | | | not run |
| Gemma-3-1B | 4 | 0.997 | L11H3 | 0.413 | 0.089 | +0.720 (-0.012) | 0.002 | 0.001 |
| Gemma-3-4B | 8 | 0.997 | L24H0 | 0.214 | 0.012 | +0.202 (-0.005) | 0.000 | 0.148 (0.056) |
| OLMo-2-1B | 16 | 0.997 | L12H8 | 0.080 | 0.056 | +0.136 (+0.022) | 0.005 | 0.007 |
| OLMo-3-7B (bf16) | 32 | 0.960 | L14H25 | 0.134 | 0.007 | +0.202 (+0.000) | 0.010 | 0.104 on the screen |
| Llama-3.2-1B | 32 | 1.000 on the screen | none on FLORES; strongest L8H25, 0.048 on the screen (a crosslingual head, section 8) | | | | | not run |
| Llama-3.2-3B | 24 | 0.992 on the screen | none on FLORES; strongest 0.008 on the screen (a crosslingual head, section 8) | | | | | not run |
| SmolLM3-3B | 16 | 0.984 on the screen | none; L1H12 0.880 on the screen breaks generation, the rest 0.016 or less (no crosslingual head either, section 8) | | | | | not run |

- Other base-model heads: among OLMo-2-1B base's heads with dNLL <= 0.1, the largest c->w is L15H5's in the last
  layer (0.134, section 3). OLMo-3-7B base has L15H20 at 0.151 and L20H18 at 0.133, which drop to 0.036 and 0.028
  under mean ablation. OLMo-2-1B instruct's L12H8 is at 0.136 on the screen and 0.080 on 2,500 prompts. With
  SmolLM3-3B's L1H12 removed, 75 of the 125 replies (12 to 18 of 25 in each language, English included) fill with
  repeated `</think>` tokens, 12 of 25 English prompts still pass on the screen, and dNLL is +2.58.
- Qwen2.5-7B: layer 0 has larger effects, L0H25 (0.629) and L0H22 (0.466), but with either removed only 0.512 and
  0.518 of the English continuations stay English, so experiments/head_rule.md picks L19H1, which keeps all of them.
  A first pipeline on L0H25 is kept in results/qwen2.5-7b*-L0H25run: replacing that head's output even with the
  prompt language's own mean still flips 0.653 of the continuations, and steering it (section 11) lowers monolingual
  LCB LPR by 0.529 and leaves 0.260 of the monolingual replies without a scorable line, so its effect is not specific
  to language.
- Detectors and CIs: relabeling the 2,500-prompt continuations with langid, fastText and a 2-of-3 vote changes each
  head's c->w by 0.02 or less: Qwen2.5-1.5B 0.500 [0.481, 0.520] with langdetect and 0.500 to 0.502 with the
  others, Qwen2.5-3B 0.515 [0.495, 0.536] and 0.518 to 0.531, Qwen3 0.324 [0.306, 0.343] and 0.326 to 0.332,
  Gemma-3-1B 0.413 [0.394, 0.431] and 0.399 to 0.413, Gemma-3-4B 0.214 [0.198, 0.230] and 0.215 to 0.223, OLMo-2
  0.080 [0.070, 0.091] and 0.083 to 0.088. Under every detector each head ranks first among the heads run on 2,500
  prompts, except Qwen3's, which ranks second behind L0H3, the head that breaks the model and is left out of the
  follow-ups.
- Reading: under zero ablation, in eight of the twelve instruct models one head is far above every other head of its
  layer (0.080 to 0.515, against at most 0.014). OLMo-3-7B's (0.134, bf16) changes LCB by less than 0.05 and nothing
  under mean ablation (section 8), so it is not counted with the other seven. In each of the seven the same head has a
  smaller effect in the base model: 0.001 and 0.007 in Gemma-3-1B and OLMo-2, 0.067 in Qwen3 (about a fifth of the
  instruct value), 0.150, 0.202 and 0.025 in Qwen2.5-1.5B, 3B and 7B (30%, 39% and 13%), 0.148 in Gemma-3-4B (69%).
  Mean ablation keeps 66% to 90% of the zero-ablation effect in Qwen2.5-1.5B and 3B and 70% in OLMo-2, but 9% in
  Qwen2.5-7B, 6% to 22% in Gemma-3 and 9% in Qwen3; section 10 tests why. OLMo-3-7B's top heads lose most of their
  effect under mean ablation (0.134 to 0.007 in instruct, 0.151 and 0.133 to 0.036 and 0.028 in base). The two Llamas,
  Qwen3-4B and SmolLM3 have no head that changes the language on FLORES without breaking generation. Effect sizes are
  not compared across models: heads per layer range from 4 to 32, and Gemma-3, OLMo-2, OLMo-3 and Qwen3 normalize
  differently from Qwen2.5, Llama and SmolLM3, so each head is compared with the other heads of its own layer.

## 8. The heads on LCB, across models

- Why: to see what the heads from section 7 do on chat prompts, in both LCB tasks.
- What: five languages, as in section 5. Each instruct model's top FLORES head with zero and mean ablation, plus
  random control heads from the same layer (three per layer, one for the Llamas). The Llamas, which have no FLORES
  head, get the top two heads of their FLORES screen. A second head was also tested in Gemma-3-1B (L5H0), OLMo-2-1B
  (L0H10) and Llama-3.2-1B (L0H1). For the two Llamas every head (512 and 672) was also screened on 100 crosslingual
  prompts, 25 per language, with the pass rate pooled over prompts, and the strongest head of the Llama-3.2-3B screen
  got the full LCB run. Qwen3-4B and SmolLM3-3B, which have no FLORES head either, got the same screen of their 1,152
  and 576 heads (SmolLM3-3B without L1H12, which breaks generation; experiments/head_rule.md), and the strongest head
  of the Qwen3-4B screen got the full LCB run.
- How: as in section 5. fp32, except OLMo-3-7B and Qwen2.5-7B in bf16.
- When / where: 2026-10-08 to 10-11 (the Qwen3-4B screen from 10-10 16:18 to 10-11 04:41 KST and its LCB run to
  05:17, the SmolLM3-3B screen from 10-10 16:49 to 10-11 00:34); results/<model>-lcb, results/<model>-lcbscreen
  for the two Llamas, Qwen3-4B and SmolLM3-3B, and results/llama3.2-3b-instruct-lcb-top and
  results/qwen3-4b-instruct-lcb-top.
- Code: lcb.py (`--screen` for the head screen).
- Result (LPR at baseline and paired change with the head removed; Qwen2.5-1.5B in section 5):

  - Second heads: Gemma-3-1B L5H0 +0.000 / +0.012, OLMo-2-1B L0H10 -0.021 / -0.054, Llama-3.2-1B L0H1 -0.004 / -0.027.
  - Share of crosslingual lines in English, baseline to zero ablation: Qwen2.5-3B 0.09 to 0.35, Qwen2.5-7B 0.04 to
    0.10, Qwen3 0.14 to 0.64, OLMo-2 0.05 to 0.28, Llama-3.2-1B 0.09 to 0.81, Llama-3.2-3B (L13H19) 0.05 to 0.36,
    Gemma-3-1B 0.55 to 0.89, Gemma-3-4B 0.44 to 0.55, Qwen3-4B (L24H27) 0.08 to 0.15. In the crosslingual replies that
    pass at baseline and fail with the head removed, 0.52 (Qwen2.5-1.5B) to 0.99 of the wrong lines are English; in
    Qwen2.5-1.5B and 3B most of the rest are Spanish.
  - Llama-3.2-1B screen: baseline 0.90; with L8H25 removed 0.19; the next heads 0.80 (L13H4), then 0.83 (L6H31 and
    L9H13). Llama-3.2-3B screen: baseline 0.94; with L13H19 removed 0.62; the next head 0.88 (L8H13). Qwen3-4B
    screen: baseline 0.908; with L24H27 removed 0.806 (a drop of 0.102, just over the 0.1 that sends a head to the
    full run); the next head 0.888 (L18H9). SmolLM3-3B screen: baseline 0.939; L1H12 takes it to 0.000 and is left
    out; the next heads 0.908 (L15H4, L21H7), a drop of 0.031, so no head got the full run.
- Reading: removing the head lowers the two tasks by different amounts in different models: by similar amounts in
  Qwen2.5 (-0.537 and -0.449 at 3B, -0.273 and -0.276 at 1.5B) and OLMo-2 (-0.272 and -0.335), mostly crosslingual in
  Qwen3 (-0.149 and -0.508), Llama-3.2-1B (-0.016 and -0.711) and Qwen2.5-7B (-0.009, a CI that includes zero, and
  -0.074), mostly monolingual in Gemma-3-1B (-0.628 and -0.091) and Gemma-3-4B (-0.259 and -0.107), whose crosslingual
  baselines are already low (0.118 and 0.133; 55% and 44% English lines). The crosslingual lines that are lost are
  mostly English (0.52 to 0.99). Llama-3.2-1B's L8H25 barely matters on FLORES (0.048 on the screen) and on
  monolingual LCB, but it is the only one of the 512 heads whose removal takes the crosslingual screen below 0.80;
  Llama-3.2-3B's L13H19 behaves the same way (monolingual +0.000, crosslingual -0.335), and so, more weakly, does
  Qwen3-4B's L24H27 (monolingual +0.000, crosslingual -0.076, the only one of its 1,152 heads that lowers the screen
  by 0.1 or more). SmolLM3-3B has no such head. On LCB, mean ablation keeps more of the zero-ablation drop than on
  FLORES for Gemma-3-1B (39% of the monolingual drop, against 22% on FLORES), Gemma-3-4B (46%, against 6%) and Qwen3
  (45% of the crosslingual drop, against 9%). The first two Llama-3.2-3B heads come from a FLORES screen where they
  tie with many others at one prompt and change nothing on LCB. OLMo-3-7B's head changes LPR by less than 0.05, and
  under mean ablation LPR does not drop (+0.001, +0.015).

## 9. Smaller checks across models

### 9a. Content of the replies that switch

- Why: to check whether the replies that switch language without the head keep the prompt's content in the other
  models, as in Qwen2.5-1.5B (section 4).
- What: Qwen2.5-3B (L27H13), Qwen3-1.7B (L18H12), Gemma-3-1B (L11H3) and OLMo-2-1B (L12H8), on their 2,500-prompt
  FLORES generations; three random control heads from the same layer.
- How: cosine similarity between the prompt and its 40-token continuation with Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B, for the
  non-English prompts that stay in their language at baseline and switch to English with the head removed. FLORES
  sentence pairs give the scale: the next sentence of the same article 0.384, a random sentence 0.179.
- When / where: 2026-10-09; results/<model>-content.
- Code: content.py (`--same-layer-controls 3`).
- Result:

| model | prompts switching to English | similarity to the prompt, before | after | before vs after continuation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen2.5-3B | 514 | 0.590 | 0.657 | 0.582 |
| Qwen3-1.7B | 739 | 0.635 | 0.683 | 0.600 |
| Gemma-3-1B | 873 | 0.639 | 0.559 | 0.586 |
| OLMo-2-1B | 101 | 0.702 | 0.668 | 0.607 |

  The control heads switch 0 to 2 prompts each.
- Reading: in all four models the English continuation is closer to the prompt than the next FLORES sentence is
  (0.559 to 0.683, against 0.384). It is closer than before the switch in the two Qwen models and less close in
  Gemma-3-1B and OLMo-2.

### 9b. OLMo-2 post-training checkpoints

- Why: OLMo-2-0425-1B releases a checkpoint after each post-training step, so L12H8 can be followed from base to
  instruct.
- What: the base model, the SFT and DPO checkpoints, and the released instruct model, which adds RLVR on math data
  after DPO (model card). FLORES layer 12 on 2,500 prompts, and LCB for L12H8 with three layer-12 control heads.
- How: as in sections 7 and 8. SFT, DPO and instruct use the same chat template and run in fp32. The base model runs
  without a template, in bf16 and with the end-of-text token blocked (section 3).
- When / where: 2026-10-08 (base) and 10-09; results/olmo2-1b, olmo2-1b-sft-instruct, olmo2-1b-dpo-instruct,
  olmo2-1b-instruct and their -lcb runs.
- Code: sweep.py, lcb.py.
- Result:

| checkpoint | FLORES non-English retention | L12H8 c->w | dNLL | rest of layer 12, max c->w | LCB mono: baseline / zero / mean | LCB cross: baseline / zero / mean |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| base | 0.921 | 0.007 | -0.000 | 0.149 (L12H0, dNLL +0.421) | | |
| SFT | 0.991 | 0.028 | +0.109 | 0.002 | 0.997 / -0.076 / -0.038 | 0.895 / -0.247 / -0.091 |
| DPO | 0.998 | 0.071 | +0.134 | 0.008 | 0.989 / -0.199 / -0.120 | 0.933 / -0.244 / -0.123 |
| instruct | 0.997 | 0.080 | +0.136 | 0.005 | 0.986 / -0.272 / -0.128 | 0.931 / -0.335 / -0.143 |

  The 95% CIs of the zero-ablation changes: monolingual [-0.095, -0.059], [-0.230, -0.172], [-0.302, -0.239];
  crosslingual [-0.273, -0.221], [-0.268, -0.219], [-0.362, -0.308]. Layer-12 controls: -0.008 to +0.005.
- Reading: L12H8's effect on FLORES goes from 0.007 in base to 0.028 after SFT, 0.071 after DPO and 0.080 in the
  released model. On LCB the crosslingual drop is the same after SFT and after DPO (overlapping CIs) and larger in the
  released model, while the monolingual drop grows at each step. This is one 1B model; the base run differs in
  precision and in blocking the end-of-text token; and the last step is RLVR on math data, so the comparison does
  not separate the effect of a single training step.

### 9c. LCB in 14 languages for more models

- Why: in Qwen2.5-1.5B, removing L22H6 changes Chinese, Japanese and Russian LPR by 0.03 or less while Hindi, Korean
  and Arabic drop (section 5). This run asks whether that pattern is specific to Qwen2.5-1.5B or shared across
  families.
- What: the smallest instruct model of every family in which a head was found: Qwen3-1.7B (L18H12), Gemma-3-1B
  (L11H3), OLMo-2-1B (L12H8) and Llama-3.2-1B (L8H25, crosslingual only); Qwen2.5 is covered by section 5. One model
  per family because the question is about families, the smallest because it matches Qwen2.5-1.5B's size and is the
  cheapest to run (the plan expected about an hour per model; they took 1 h 8 min to 2 h 16 min). The larger models
  of the same families would test size and are left out for time. Qwen2.5-3B (L27H13) was added after these four,
  before its run (lcb14_plan.md, 16:48 KST), to ask whether the pattern belongs to Qwen2.5 or to the 1.5B model.
- How: as the 14-language run of section 5: zero and mean ablation of the head, three random same-layer controls,
  each model's settings from section 8, WPR for ar, hi, ja, ko, ru and zh with the number of replies it rests on.
- When / where: 2026-10-10, Qwen3-1.7B 07:24 to 09:40 KST, Gemma-3-1B 10:49 to 12:35, OLMo-2-1B 12:45 to 14:31 and
  Llama-3.2-1B 14:41 to 15:49, Qwen2.5-3B 16:49 to 20:19 (sharing the GPU with two screens); results/<model>-lcb-all
  (judge.md, wpr.md); the same reading applied to section 5's run in results/qwen-instruct-lcb-all/judge.md.
- Code: lcb.py, lcb14_judge.py (the planned reading; --skipped-fail for the check outside the plan), lcb_wpr.py.
- Planned reading, set before the runs (experiments/lcb14_plan.md): a language counts as affected if the head's paired
  change under zero ablation has a CI below zero and is below every control's change; the Qwen2.5-1.5B pattern is read
  as shared by a model if, on monolingual prompts, Hindi is affected and Chinese, Japanese and Russian are not. All
  models are reported; for Qwen2.5-3B, sharing it is read as a Qwen2.5 trait and not sharing it as a property of the
  1.5B model.
- Result:
  - The reading on section 5's run reproduces the pattern: Hindi is affected (-0.602 [-0.704, -0.500]) and Chinese
    (+0.000), Japanese (-0.010) and Russian (+0.000) are not. 10 of 14 languages are affected on monolingual prompts
    (not de, ja, ru, zh) and 12 of 14 on crosslingual ones (not ja, ru).
  - Qwen2.5-3B: monolingual LPR 0.987 to 0.478 (-0.520 [-0.543, -0.498]) and crosslingual 0.869 to 0.406 (-0.457
    [-0.473, -0.441]) under zero ablation; mean ablation -0.555 and -0.463; controls -0.001 to +0.002 and -0.037 to
    +0.009. 13 of 14 languages are affected on monolingual prompts, all but Chinese (+0.005 [-0.020, +0.030]), among
    them Japanese (-0.700), Russian (-0.372) and Hindi (-0.368). All 14 are affected on crosslingual prompts (-0.166
    to -0.826).
  - Qwen2.5-3B skips 279 of 2,200 monolingual replies without the head (5 at baseline) and 251 of 4,186 crosslingual
    ones (62). 273 and 204 of them are written mainly in Han characters or kana: the line check counts words by
    spaces unless the expected language is Chinese or Japanese, so their lines have fewer than five words and none
    is scored. Most are Korean (91 of 100 monolingual, 162 of 299 crosslingual), Arabic (80 of 300 monolingual) and
    Vietnamese (41 of 100 monolingual), so the monolingual changes of these three rest on 9, 220 and 59 replies and
    leave out replies that switched. WPR at baseline: 0.95 to 1.00 monolingual, 0.88 to 0.98 crosslingual; without
    the head some cells rest on few replies (monolingual Korean none, crosslingual Korean 14), so it is not read.
  - Qwen3-1.7B: monolingual LPR 0.971 to 0.658 (-0.293 [-0.313, -0.273]) and crosslingual 0.789 to 0.198 (-0.592
    [-0.608, -0.577]) under zero ablation; mean ablation -0.304 and -0.497; controls -0.004 to +0.003 and +0.002 to
    +0.009. 12 of 14 languages are affected on monolingual prompts, all but Vietnamese (-0.020 [-0.060, +0.020]) and
    Chinese (-0.015 [-0.065, +0.035]), among them Japanese (-0.570), Russian (-0.300) and Hindi (-0.220). All 14 are
    affected on crosslingual prompts (-0.456 to -0.760).
  - Qwen3-1.7B skips 28 of 2,200 monolingual replies without the head (3 at baseline) and 68 of 4,186 crosslingual
    ones (66).
  - Qwen3-1.7B WPR at baseline: 0.97 to 1.00 monolingual, 0.89 to 0.96 crosslingual. Without the head few replies stay
    in the language in some cells (crosslingual Korean 1, Chinese 12, Japanese 16), so WPR under ablation is not read.
  - Gemma-3-1B: monolingual LPR 0.978 to 0.266 (-0.730 [-0.748, -0.710]) and crosslingual 0.129 to 0.013 (-0.113
    [-0.123, -0.102]) under zero ablation; mean ablation -0.488 and -0.117; controls +0.000 to +0.001 and -0.014 to
    +0.050. All 14 languages are affected on monolingual prompts (-0.520 for Portuguese to -0.980 for Vietnamese;
    Chinese -0.840, Japanese -0.788, Russian -0.550, Hindi -0.919) and on crosslingual ones (-0.048 to -0.276), where
    the baseline is already low, as in the five-language run (section 8).
  - Gemma-3-1B skips 6 of 2,200 monolingual replies without the head (2 at baseline) and 108 of 4,186 crosslingual
    ones (77). Its crosslingual WPR rests on 19 to 46 replies per language at baseline and 0 to 7 without the head,
    so only the monolingual baseline (0.98 to 1.00) is read.
  - OLMo-2-1B: monolingual LPR 0.976 to 0.662 (-0.346 [-0.367, -0.327]) and crosslingual 0.873 to 0.491 (-0.379
    [-0.394, -0.364]); mean ablation -0.445 and -0.442; controls -0.002 to +0.002 and -0.002 to +0.010. 13 of 14
    languages are affected on monolingual prompts, all but Hindi (-0.010 [-0.061, +0.040]), among them Japanese
    (-0.577), Chinese (-0.355) and Russian (-0.253); all 14 on crosslingual prompts (-0.140 to -0.692). It skips 42 of
    2,200 monolingual replies without the head (27 at baseline) and 81 of 4,186 crosslingual ones (76). Here WPR rests
    on 75 to 216 crosslingual replies per language without the head and drops from 0.86 to 0.97 at baseline (0.83 to
    0.97 under the controls) to 0.65 to 0.85: the replies that stay in the language carry more English words.
  - Llama-3.2-1B: monolingual LPR 0.985 to 0.902 (-0.069 [-0.081, -0.058]) and crosslingual 0.778 to 0.084 (-0.695
    [-0.709, -0.681]); mean ablation -0.101 and -0.485; controls -0.003 to +0.000 and -0.015 to +0.003. On
    crosslingual prompts all 14 languages are affected (-0.579 to -0.764). On monolingual prompts 6 of 14 are: Korean
    (-0.388), Turkish (-0.303), Japanese (-0.180), Arabic (-0.100), Chinese (-0.095) and Italian (-0.090). The plan
    expected flat monolingual results for this head, as in the five-language run of section 8 (-0.016); of those four
    languages only Italian is affected here. It skips 9 of 2,200 monolingual replies with or without the head and 4 of
    4,186 crosslingual ones (26 at baseline). Crosslingual WPR without the head rests on 0 to 45 replies per language
    and is not read.
  - Outside the plan (lcb14_judge.py --skipped-fail, judge_skipped_fail.md in each run): LCB's scorer, which lcb.py
    follows, leaves out a reply that has no line of five words instead of counting it as a failure. Counting the
    replies an intervention leaves unscorable as failures changes no affected language and no reading in the six
    models; Russian in Qwen2.5-1.5B stays unaffected at -0.010 [-0.030, +0.000]. The changes that move by 0.05 or
    more are Korean in Qwen2.5-1.5B (monolingual -0.084 to -0.206, crosslingual -0.093 to -0.220), Qwen3-1.7B
    (monolingual -0.605 to -0.700) and OLMo-2 (monolingual -0.440 to -0.490), and in Qwen2.5-3B monolingual Arabic
    (-0.668 to -0.750), Russian (-0.372 to -0.460) and Turkish (-0.655 to -0.710) and crosslingual Korean (-0.647 to
    -0.831).
  - Script switches (experiments/script_switch.py by Seunghyeok Hong, results/script-switch/summary.md): replies with
    more Han or kana characters than characters of the expected script, zh and ja left out. With the head removed,
    monolingual Korean replies switch in Qwen2.5-3B (95 of 100), Qwen3-1.7B (63), Qwen2.5-1.5B (17), OLMo-2 (13),
    Gemma-3-1B and Llama-3.2-1B (5 each), against 0 or 1 at baseline. Of the switched replies in the three Qwen
    models, 90, 23 and 11 are skipped and 0, 17 and 3 pass: a reply passes when its lines of five words are all still
    in Korean. In Qwen2.5-3B switches also reach monolingual Arabic (101 of 300), Turkish and Vietnamese (46 of 100
    each) and Russian (17); in Qwen2.5-1.5B one Russian reply switches.

| model | head | monolingual: languages not affected | crosslingual: languages not affected | Qwen2.5-1.5B pattern |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen2.5-1.5B | L22H6 | de, ja, ru, zh | ja, ru | yes |
| Qwen2.5-3B | L27H13 | zh | none | no |
| Qwen3-1.7B | L18H12 | vi, zh | none | no |
| Gemma-3-1B | L11H3 | none | none | no |
| OLMo-2-1B | L12H8 | hi | none | no |
| Llama-3.2-1B | L8H25 | de, es, fr, hi, id, pt, ru, vi | none | no |

- Reading: by the planned rule, neither Qwen2.5-3B nor any of the four other families shares the Qwen2.5-1.5B
  pattern, so it is read as a property of the 1.5B model. On crosslingual prompts the head matters in all 14
  languages in every other model. On monolingual prompts the languages it leaves alone differ from model to model:
  Japanese and Russian, which L22H6 leaves alone, drop in Qwen2.5-3B, Qwen3, Gemma-3 and OLMo-2, and Hindi, which
  drops in Qwen2.5-1.5B (-0.602), is unaffected in OLMo-2 and Llama. Chinese is unaffected in the three Qwen models
  and affected in the other three families.

### 9d. The heads under the Translation Heads method

- Why: Translation Heads (arXiv 2602.04613, ICML 2026) finds "language heads" that pick the output language in
  few-shot translation, by activation patching on base models, including three models we have heads for. This checks
  whether their method picks the same heads.
- What: the per-head scores the authors publish (github.com/Blyzi/mitra, commit daa721b) for Qwen3-1.7B-Base,
  Llama-3.2-1B and Gemma-3-1B-pt: 20 directions (English to and from fr, es, pt, ja, zh, sw, wo, hi, ar, ru), 50 to
  142 FLORES examples per direction. Our heads: L18H12, L8H25 and L11H3, found in the instruct models.
- How: their top-head rule (src/representation/top_head.py): average each direction over its examples, take the top
  head of each direction, and rank heads by how many directions they top. We also rank our head by the score averaged
  over directions. Nothing is rerun; their files are only read.
- When / where: 2026-10-10; results/mitra-check/summary.txt.
- Code: mitra_rank.py.
- Result:
  - Qwen3-1.7B-Base: L18H12 is the top head in all 20 directions.
  - Llama-3.2-1B: L8H25 tops 7 directions (6 of the 10 from English), L9H8 7 (all into English) and L13H4 4. L8H25 has
    the highest score averaged over all 20 directions and over the 10 from English. On en->fr it tops 90 of 142
    examples and L12H7 47; a one-example run in the circuit repo (ctli PR #14) had put L12H7 first.
  - Gemma-3-1B-pt: L15H2 tops all 20 directions. L11H3 tops none and ranks 3rd of 104 on the average over all 20
    (5th from English, 2nd into English).
- Reading: on base models in few-shot translation, their method picks our head in Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-1B and a
  different one in Gemma-3-1B. Our heads were found in the instruct models, and in the base models they have little
  effect on FLORES continuations (Qwen3 0.067, Gemma-3-1B 0.001; Llama's base was not run, section 7). So the match
  shows that the head we found in the instruct model is the one their method ranks highest in the base model's
  translation; it does not show that the head acts the same way in both settings.

## 10. Why zero and mean ablation differ

- Why: in section 7, mean ablation keeps most of the zero-ablation effect in Qwen2.5 and OLMo-2 and little of it in
  Gemma-3, Qwen3 and OLMo-3. This run tests four explanations for the gap: the zeroed input is out of distribution;
  the norm applied to the attention output (Gemma-3, OLMo-2) rescales the other heads when one is zeroed; the model
  relies on a constant part of the head's output, which mean ablation keeps; or the head carries information that
  differs with the prompt's language.
- What: L22H6 (Qwen2.5-1.5B), L27H13 (Qwen2.5-3B), L18H12 (Qwen3-1.7B), L11H3 (Gemma-3-1B), L24H0 (Gemma-3-4B) and
  L12H8 (OLMo-2-1B), each on the 2,500 FLORES prompts, in the precision of section 7; L19H1 (Qwen2.5-7B) was added
  on 2026-10-10 with the same design.
- How:
  - Statistics of the head's contribution after the output projection over the user's text and the baseline
    continuation. The template tokens before the user's text are left out, since the head's output there is the
    same for every prompt. Reported: the mean norm and its rank in the layer, the share of the energy in the mean
    vector, the share of the remaining variance explained by the prompt's language, and the cosine between the
    follow-up's mean (all prompt tokens, template included) and the mean over continuation tokens.
  - Generation with the head replaced by: zero; the follow-up's mean; the continuation mean; the head minus the
    continuation mean; the mean of the prompt's own language; the English mean; the mean of another language
    (German for en/fr/es/it prompts, French for de prompts); a random vector with the same norm at each position;
    half its value; and, for Gemma-3 and OLMo-2, zero with the post-attention norm held at its clean value. Every
    condition is generated in per-language batches.
- When / where: 2026-10-09, 18:37 to 19:58 KST, and Qwen2.5-7B on 2026-10-10, 11:17 to 11:31 KST;
  results/<model>-diag (summary.md, stats.json, labels.json and every continuation in gens.jsonl.gz).
- Code: diagnose.py. Its parts were checked on small random models before this run.
- Planned reading, set before the results: flips with the random vector point to an out-of-distribution input; an
  effect that disappears when the norm is held fixed points to the norm; an effect from subtracting the mean points
  to a constant signal; a difference between the follow-up's mean and the continuation mean shows that the result of
  mean ablation depends on which tokens the mean is taken over; replies that move to the swapped-in language mean the
  head carries language identity. Section 2 has a version of the language-mean test for GPT-2's L6H10, where every
  language mean acted like ablation.
- Result (c->w on the 2,500 prompts; in brackets, the share of non-English replies in the swapped-in language):

| model | head | norm rank in layer | mean's share of the energy | language's share of the rest | zero | follow-up mean | continuation mean | minus continuation mean | own-language mean | English mean | other-language mean | random, same norm | x0.5 | zero, norm held |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen2.5-1.5B | L22H6 | 1 of 12 | 0.18 | 0.62 | 0.501 | 0.451 | 0.431 | 0.027 | 0.052 | 0.486 | 0.530 (0.182) | 0.544 | 0.071 | |
| Qwen2.5-3B | L27H13 | 2 of 16 | 0.38 | 0.71 | 0.515 | 0.338 | 0.372 | 0.059 | 0.001 | 0.595 | 0.794 (0.996) | 0.636 | 0.047 | |
| Qwen2.5-7B | L19H1 | 2 of 28 | 0.38 | 0.77 | 0.202 | 0.021 | 0.008 | 0.070 | 0.000 | 0.188 | 0.352 (0.417) | 0.228 | 0.017 | |
| Qwen3-1.7B | L18H12 | 1 of 16 | 0.34 | 0.56 | 0.324 | 0.028 | 0.155 | 0.138 | 0.000 | 0.667 | 0.780 (0.904) | 0.377 | 0.009 | |
| Gemma-3-1B | L11H3 | 1 of 4 | 0.76 | 0.03 | 0.413 | 0.089 | 0.196 | 0.070 | 0.000 | 0.782 | 0.977 (0.997) | 0.666 | 0.008 | 0.160 |
| Gemma-3-4B | L24H0 | 2 of 8 | 0.56 | 0.73 | 0.214 | 0.012 | 0.011 | 0.003 | 0.000 | 0.222 | 0.796 (0.989) | 0.291 | 0.000 | 0.234 |
| OLMo-2-1B | L12H8 | 2 of 16 | 0.31 | 0.67 | 0.080 | 0.056 | 0.054 | 0.005 | 0.000 | 0.100 | 0.750 (0.910) | 0.130 | 0.005 | 0.074 |

  - The statistics are over the user's text and the continuation. Zero and the follow-up mean reproduce section 7
    (Qwen2.5-1.5B 0.501 and 0.451 here, 0.500 and 0.450 there, from the per-language batches).
  - Where the replies go with the head zeroed: mostly English in Qwen2.5-1.5B (919 of 1,252 flips), Qwen3 (739 of
    811) and Gemma-3-1B (873 of 1,032); English (514), Chinese (299), Spanish and Portuguese (378) of 1,288 in
    Qwen2.5-3B; Portuguese and Spanish in Gemma-3-4B (453 of 535, 78 English); Chinese in Qwen2.5-7B (439 of 505, 33
    English). The first flipped 7B replies we read are fluent Chinese on the prompt's topic; the random vector (485 of
    570) and the English mean (399 of 469) send replies to Chinese as well, while English prompts stay English (500 of
    500).
  - In Qwen3, Gemma-3-1B and Qwen2.5-3B the means over all five languages move replies mostly to another European
    language: Qwen3's continuation mean sends 347 of 388 flips to Italian, Gemma-3-1B's sends 418 of 491 to French
    and Italian, and Qwen2.5-3B's follow-up mean sends 626 of 846 to French and Spanish. In Qwen2.5-1.5B they send
    replies mostly to English (0.476 and 0.447 of the non-English replies).
  - The follow-up mean and the continuation mean have cosine 0.64 (Qwen3) to 0.99 (Gemma-3-4B). In Gemma-3-1B the
    cosine is 0.97 but their distance is 3.32 times the continuation mean's norm, so the follow-up mean is about 4.3
    times longer. The two give different c->w in Qwen3 (0.028 and 0.155) and Gemma-3-1B (0.089 and 0.196) and agree
    within 0.04 in the other models.
- Reading, against the planned reading:
  - Out of distribution: the random vector moves at least as many replies as zero in every model, but it also removes
    the head's output, so it does not separate the two. The mean of another language, a value at the center of the
    head's outputs for that language, moves more replies than zero in every model, and the prompt's own language mean
    moves almost none (0.001 or less, 0.052 in Qwen2.5-1.5B). The effect does not need an out-of-distribution input.
  - Norm: holding the post-attention norm explains part of the zero-ablation effect in Gemma-3-1B (0.413 to 0.160),
    not in Gemma-3-4B (0.234) or OLMo-2 (0.074).
  - Constant signal: removing the continuation mean moves 0.003 to 0.070 of the replies, 0.138 in Qwen3, so the
    effect does not come mainly from the constant part of the output, except partly in Qwen3.
  - Which tokens the mean is taken over matters in Qwen3 and Gemma-3-1B.
  - Language identity: in five of the seven models the head's output sets the language of the continuation; in
    Qwen2.5-1.5B it does not (0.182), and Qwen2.5-7B is in between (0.417). In Gemma-3-1B the prompt's language
    explains 0.03 of the variance around the mean, and another language's mean still moves 0.997. In Qwen3, Gemma-3-1B
    and Qwen2.5-3B the mean over five languages is not neutral: the replies it moves go mostly to another European
    language. In Gemma-3 and Qwen3 a small mean-ablation effect therefore does not show that the head carries little:
    one language's mean moves 0.78 to 0.98 of all prompts there. This differs from GPT-2's L6H10, where every language
    mean acted like ablation (section 2).

## 11. Steering the heads on LCB

- Why: in section 10, replacing the head's output with its mean output for another language moves FLORES replies into
  that language in five of the six models. This run asks whether the same vectors set the reply language on chat
  prompts, and whether they raise the crosslingual pass rate of the models that often answer in English (Gemma-3-1B
  0.118 and Gemma-3-4B 0.133, section 8).
- What: the six heads of section 7 (Qwen2.5-1.5B L22H6, Qwen2.5-3B L27H13, Qwen3-1.7B L18H12, Gemma-3-1B L11H3,
  Gemma-3-4B L24H0, OLMo-2-1B L12H8) and the three same-layer control heads of each model's LCB run (sections 5 and
  8), on the same five-language LCB prompts: fr/de/es/it monolingual (800) and crosslingual (1,196), English
  monolingual (200). Qwen2.5-7B's L19H1 was added on 2026-10-10 with the same design.
- How:
  - Vectors: the head's per-language mean output from section 10 (2,500 FLORES prompts, user's text and baseline
    continuation). Nothing is computed on LCB.
  - steer replaces the head's output with the mean of the language the reply should be in, swap with the mean of
    another language (German for en/fr/es/it, French for de). add steer and add swap add that mean minus the mean
    over all languages instead, with the coefficient fixed at 1. All four run on the head and on the three controls.
    The head is changed at every position (template, prompt and reply), as in section 10 and in mean ablation.
  - Precision, batching and greedy decoding as in sections 5 and 8, so the baseline should reproduce those runs.
  - Reported: LPR and its paired change with a bootstrap 95% CI, the share of replies entirely in the swap language
    with a bootstrap CI, the share of English lines, repetition, and the share of replies that the 5-word line filter
    skips.
  - Quality (steer_quality.py, added after the first condition of Gemma-3-1B had finished, as a check rather than a
    criterion): embedding similarity (Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B) between each reply and the baseline reply to the same
    prompt, against the baseline reply to another prompt of the same task and language; and the perplexity of each
    reply under the unmodified model, against the baseline replies in the same language. The encoder runs in
    bfloat16, its checkpoint's precision, as in content.py, so a text compared with itself scores 1.001.
- When / where: 2026-10-09 20:03 to 2026-10-10 07:12 KST, and Qwen2.5-7B on 2026-10-10, 11:31 to 13:59 KST;
  results/<model>-steer (summary.md, quality.md, means.pt and every reply in samples.jsonl.gz).
- Code: steer.py, steer_quality.py. The replacement for each prompt inside a mixed-language batch was checked
  against single-prompt runs on a small random model.
- Planned reading, set before the results (experiments/steer_plan.md):
  - The head sets the reply language on LCB if its share of replies in the swap language has a CI above every
    control's share.
  - steer fixes crosslingual replies if the change in crosslingual LPR has a CI above zero and above every control's
    change, while the skipped share and repetition rise by no more than 0.05.
  - Replace and add are reported side by side, and all six models are reported.
  - If Gemma-3-1B's crosslingual change under steer does not have a CI above zero, a second run takes the vectors from
    the LCB monolingual baseline replies and applies them to the crosslingual prompts only, to tell a FLORES vs chat
    domain gap from a head that does not set the language in chat.
  - LPR checks only the language. Whether steered replies keep the content of the baseline replies is checked
    afterwards with embedding similarity.
- Result (changes are paired against each model's baseline, which matches sections 5 and 8 in all six):

| model | head | cross baseline | steer: mono change [95% CI] | steer: cross change [95% CI] | swap: replies in the swapped-in language, mono / cross | add steer: cross change | add swap: mono / cross | controls: cross change / swap share |

  - Gemma-3-1B, crosslingual LPR under steer by language: German 0.08 to 0.82, French 0.16 to 0.47, Spanish 0.11 to
    0.46, Italian 0.14 to 0.49. Under swap, English prompts are answered in German in 0.585 of Gemma-3-1B's replies,
    0.040 of Qwen3's and none of the other models'. In Qwen2.5-1.5B swap still takes monolingual LPR down by 0.335.
  - Quality: the crosslingual replies that steer turns from fail to pass (530, 98, 31, 43, 20 and 16 in the order of
    the table) have cosine 0.69 to 0.84 with the baseline reply to the same prompt, against 0.15 to 0.21 with the
    baseline reply to another prompt of the same task and language; the monolingual replies that swap moves out of
    their language have 0.67 to 0.72, against 0.15 to 0.19. The median perplexity of the fixed replies under the
    unmodified model is lower than that of the baseline crosslingual replies in the requested language in the two
    Gemma models (4.9 against 5.8, 7.0 against 8.3) and within 0.1 of it in the other four.
- Reading against the plan:
  - Swap: by the rule fixed in advance, the head sets the reply language on LCB in all six models (the share's CI is
    above the controls' 0.000). The size differs: 0.84 to 0.99 of the monolingual replies in five models and 0.043 in
    Qwen2.5-1.5B. On crosslingual prompts the swapped-in language wins over the requested one in 0.70 to 0.83 of the
    replies in Qwen2.5-3B, OLMo-2 and Qwen3, 0.594 in Gemma-3-1B, 0.137 in Gemma-3-4B and 0.019 in Qwen2.5-1.5B.
  - Fix: steer fixes crosslingual replies in Gemma-3-1B (+0.440) and Gemma-3-4B (+0.079): the CIs are above zero and
    above every control's change (at most +0.034 and +0.008), and the skipped share and repetition rise by 0.002 or
    less. It does not in the other four: Qwen2.5-3B, Qwen3 and OLMo-2 (CIs include zero; baselines 0.82 to 0.93) and
    Qwen2.5-1.5B (-0.020). Crosslingual LPR stays at 0.560 and 0.213 in the two Gemma models.
  - No harm: steer's monolingual change has a CI that includes zero in five models and is +0.013 in Gemma-3-1B.
  - Add: add swap moves fewer replies into the swapped-in language than swap in every model (0.83 of the monolingual
    replies in Gemma-3-1B, 0.17 or less in the others). add steer's change has a CI above zero in Gemma-3-1B,
    Gemma-3-4B, Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen3 (+0.018 to +0.047) and above every control's change only in Gemma-3-4B; in
    Qwen2.5-1.5B it lowers crosslingual LPR (-0.042).
  - The second run with LCB vectors is not needed, since Gemma-3-1B's crosslingual change has a CI above zero.
  - Qwen2.5-7B, read by the same rules: swap sets the reply language (0.122 and 0.128, above the controls' 0.000), but
    in about an eighth of the replies, closer to Qwen2.5-1.5B than to the other five; swap still lowers monolingual
    LPR by 0.280. steer does not fix crosslingual replies (-0.003, baseline 0.950) and does no harm on monolingual
    ones (+0.003, CI includes zero). Its baseline matches section 8.

## 12. Still running

- Nothing. The Qwen3-4B and SmolLM3-3B crosslingual screens finished on 2026-10-11 (section 8).

## What the results support and what they do not

Supported so far:
- In seven of the twelve instruct models, removing one attention head takes non-English replies out of their language
  far more than removing any other head of the same layer, on FLORES (0.080 to 0.515, against at most 0.014) and on
  LCB, in Qwen2.5-7B on crosslingual prompts only (sections 7 and 8). OLMo-3-7B has such a head under zero ablation on
  FLORES only. In both Llama-3.2 models and, more weakly, in Qwen3-4B one head does this for crosslingual requests
  (section 8); on 14 languages Llama-3.2-1B's also lowers six languages on monolingual prompts (section 9c).
- The replies that switch stay close to the prompt in content: their similarity to the prompt is above that of the
  next sentence of the same article (sections 4 and 9a).
- In Qwen2.5-1.5B the effect holds on LCB chat prompts, under sampling, and with or without the default system prompt
  (sections 4 and 5); the heads of Qwen2.5-3B, Qwen3, Gemma-3-1B, Gemma-3-4B and OLMo-2 also lower LCB scores, and
  Llama-3.2-1B's L8H25, Llama-3.2-3B's L13H19, Qwen2.5-7B's L19H1 and Qwen3-4B's L24H27 lower crosslingual ones
  (section 8). On crosslingual prompts in 14 languages, the heads of the six models run lower all 14, except Japanese
  and Russian in Qwen2.5-1.5B (sections 5 and 9c).
- In each of the seven models the same head has a smaller effect in the base model (section 7), and in Qwen2.5-1.5B
  the dependence is large only for the instruct model with its own chat template (section 4).
- In Qwen2.5-1.5B the head acts mostly while the reply is generated, on crosslingual prompts (with the Italian ones
  selected among prompts that switch) and on monolingual prompts drawn without selection, and on crosslingual prompts
  it attends to the requested language word (section 6). Most of the effect in both runs is on Italian. Gemma-3-1B's
  L11H3 also attends to the requested word, and masking that access during generation costs about as many of its
  12 passing crosslingual replies as removing the head then (7 and 8; section 6). In both models, on the same 96
  prompts drawn without selection, masking the head's access to the word fails replies (6 of 62 and 7 of 12) and
  masking the access of the layer's next most attending head fails none (section 6).
- On FLORES, in five of the seven models, replacing the head's output with one language's mean output moves 0.904 to
  0.997 of the non-English continuations into that language (0.417 in Qwen2.5-7B, 0.182 in Qwen2.5-1.5B), and the
  prompt's own language mean keeps them (section 10).
- On LCB, the same replacement moves 0.84 to 0.99 of the monolingual replies into the swapped-in language in five
  models (0.122 in Qwen2.5-7B, 0.043 in Qwen2.5-1.5B), and replacing the head's output with the requested language's
  mean raises crosslingual LPR in Gemma-3-1B (0.118 to 0.560) and Gemma-3-4B (0.133 to 0.213), with replies that stay
  close to the baseline replies in content (section 11).
- The language-head method of Translation Heads, run by its authors on base models in few-shot translation, ranks
  our head first in Qwen3-1.7B (top head in all 20 directions) and Llama-3.2-1B (tied first by their count, first on
  the average), but not in Gemma-3-1B (section 9d).

Not supported, or not tested:
- That the languages L22H6 leaves alone in Qwen2.5-1.5B (Chinese, Japanese, Russian) are left alone in other models:
  neither Qwen2.5-3B nor any of the four other families shares that pattern (on monolingual prompts Chinese is left
  alone in all three Qwen models, Japanese only in Qwen2.5-1.5B, Russian in Qwen2.5-1.5B and Llama-3.2-1B), and
  which languages a head leaves alone differs by model (section 9c).
- That instruction tuning creates the head: in Qwen2.5 and Gemma-3-4B the same head is already there in the base model
  with a smaller effect; in Gemma-3-1B and OLMo-2 it is absent from the base model, and these runs do not show what
  produces it (section 7).
- That every instruct model has such a head: none was found on FLORES in Qwen3-4B, OLMo-3-7B or SmolLM3-3B;
  SmolLM3-3B has none on the crosslingual screen either, OLMo-3-7B did not get that screen, and the two Llamas and
  Qwen3-4B have one that acts mainly on crosslingual requests (sections 7, 8 and 9c).
- That the head's output sets the reply language in Qwen2.5-1.5B (0.182 on FLORES, 0.043 on LCB), and it does so
  only partly in Qwen2.5-7B (0.417 and 0.122; sections 10 and 11).
- That steering with the head fixes language confusion in general: it raises crosslingual LPR in the two Gemma
  models, whose crosslingual baselines are low (0.118 and 0.133), and not in the other five (section 11).
- That the effect is the same under mean ablation: it holds in Qwen2.5-1.5B, Qwen2.5-3B and OLMo-2 but not in
  Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-3, Qwen3 or OLMo-3 (section 7).
- A ranking of effect sizes across models: heads per layer and normalization differ (section 7).
- Which post-training step produces the dependence (section 9b).
- That access to the language word explains the head's effect: in Qwen2.5-1.5B masking it reproduces 7 of 27
  switches (6 of 20 on prompts drawn without selection), and in Gemma-3-1B it fails 7 of 12 passing replies, of
  which 4 also fail without the head (section 6).
- The first-token broadcaster claims of the submitted version (section 1).

## Known limitations

- Twelve instruct models from seven families, 1B to 7B parameters. FLORES covers five European languages; LCB covers
  the same four non-English ones for every model and 14 languages for Qwen2.5-1.5B, Qwen2.5-3B and the smallest
  model of four other families (section 9c). Steering uses the four European languages only, since its vectors come
  from the FLORES prompts.
- OLMo-2-1B has a 4,096-token context. Three long crosslingual prompts per language (from LCB's complex_prompts
  source) leave too little room for the 100-token reply, so 42 of the 6,586 prompts of its 14-language run, and the
  same prompts in its five-language runs, generate past the limit.
- LCB's line check counts words by spaces unless the expected language is Chinese or Japanese, and leaves out a reply
  with no line of five words, so a reply that switches into Chinese or Japanese from another language is left out
  rather than counted as a failure. Without the head this leaves out 279 of 2,200 monolingual replies in Qwen2.5-3B,
  most of them in Chinese or Japanese script, and 6 to 42 in the other five 14-language runs. Counting them as
  failures changes no reading (section 9c). A reply whose lines of five words are in the expected language passes
  even when the rest of it is in Chinese or Japanese, since those lines are not scored; results/script-switch counts
  both cases (section 9c).
- Steering replaces or shifts the head's output at every position with fixed vectors; replacing it only while the
  reply is generated, or with vectors taken from chat replies, was not run.
- Single-turn prompts. Instruct models use their default chat template, including Qwen2.5's English system prompt.
- Interventions act on one head at a time: zero, mean and scaling, plus phase-limited ablation and attention masking
  in section 6. Several heads at once only for GPT-2. The mean used for mean ablation includes the chat template
  tokens of instruct models; section 10 also uses means taken without them.
- FLORES labels come from langdetect on a 40-token continuation. LCB labels come from fastText per line and skip
  lines under five words, so Korean replies that turn into Chinese or Japanese are skipped and the Korean drop is
  understated (section 5).
- In section 7, head selection uses c->w on 125 prompts and does not look at dNLL, so a head that breaks generation
  can pass the threshold (SmolLM3-3B L1H12, dNLL +2.58). The follow-ups of section 7 skip heads with dNLL above 1,
  and since 2026-10-10 heads whose removal keeps less than 0.9 of English continuations in English
  (experiments/head_rule.md).
- Mean and zero ablation disagree in Gemma-3, Qwen3 and OLMo-3. Section 10 accounts for part of it in Gemma-3 and
  Qwen3; OLMo-3 was not in section 10.
- Precision: OLMo-3-7B in bf16, where batched and single-prompt generations agree on only 10 of 20 prompts;
  Qwen2.5-7B in bf16, 15 of 20; OLMo-2-1B base in bf16 with the end-of-text token blocked. Section 6 runs
  Qwen2.5-1.5B in fp32 (transformers 4.57.6, the monolingual run 5.18.0), sections 4 and 5 in fp16.
- Base models were not run for Llama-3.2 and SmolLM3-3B. OLMo-3-7B base has L14H25 only on the 125-prompt screen.
- Gemma-3-1B's crosslingual LCB baseline is 0.118, too low to read a change.
- Qwen2.5-Instruct's generation config adds a repetition penalty (1.1 for 1.5B, 1.05 for 3B) to every greedy run.
- The section 6 results come from one model and 96 prompts, and the Italian prompts were selected among ones that
  switch.
